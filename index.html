    <h2>What are Mycelium?</h2>
        <p><b>Mycelium</b> is a root-like structure of a fungus consisting of a mass of thread-like branches called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha">hyphae</a>. They are found in many places in the forest and most of all have underground networks that allow plants and trees to exchange nutrients. </p>
    <h2>Fruiting Bodies</h2>
        <p>Mycelium have fruiting bodies called <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus">fungi</a></b>, and some fungi are commonly known as <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom">mushrooms</a></b>.</p>
    <h2>Where to find Mycelium</h2>
        <p>Mycelium can be found all over the world in fields, forest, and heavily wooded areas. <br> 
        <br>
        The largest known organism in the world is a mycelium called <b><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillaria">Armillaria</a></em></b> which covers more than 3.4 square miles in Oregon's <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/malheur">Malheur National Forest</a> and is estimated to be 2,500 years old. Its mycelium grows on wooded trees and shrubs, and it fruits a shiny yellow mushroom. This specific species of fungi display <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioluminescence#:~:text=Bioluminescence%20is%20the%20production%20and,terrestrial%20arthropods%20such%20as%20fireflies.">bioluminescence</a>, which makes it glow at night.</p>
    <h2>Uses</h2>
        <p>The primary role of fungi is to decompose organic materials like plants, animals, or even chemicals. Mycelium has been used to make materials such as <a href="https://www.mylo-unleather.com/">artificial leather</a>. <br>
        <br> 
        Widely known are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edible_mushroom">edible mushrooms</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin">some fungus can be used as medicine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom"> others have psychoactive effects</a> when ingested by some organisms including humans (<em>yes you!</em>); This particular group of mushrooms has been used centuries for sacred Indigenous ritual.</p>
